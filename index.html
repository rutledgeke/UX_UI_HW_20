      <p class="lead">Case Study</p>
      <hr class="my-4">
      <p>Our team chose the nonprofit of Summit Dog Rescue to re-design. We felt that we could help them make their site
        more user-friendly and enhance the design. The process started with user research through interviews and surveys
        to build the base of our project. We also conducted a competitive analysis. From there, we compiled the issues
        with design and functionality based on our research and developed a solution. Next, we started to lay out the
        design by wireframing and prototypes, eventually creating the final design.</p>

              <h4>Surveys</h4>
              <p class="card-text">We collected 28 user surveys and 5 user interviews to gather information on how
                people interact with animal adoption.
                Based on our user research we found a few interesting points. Many people go straight to the pet page
                and do not explore other pages on the site. We also found that over 80% of people we collected surveys
                from felt that the images and descriptions of the pets were most important.</p>

              <p class="card-text">We found through our research that our target audience had a fairly wide range of
                ages. Also, our research showed that many dog owners are active and like the outdoors. With a clearer
                understanding of our demographics and user needs, we crafted a story to help display the needs and wants
                of our users. This helped us define how the user would navigate the site and what was most valuable to
                their experience in selecting a dog adoption agency.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Our team was able to see that a few competitors offered some unique services that
                might enhance the customer experience at Summit Pet Rescue. One popular service that some other
                organizations offer was a food/pet supply delivery service. Our team felt that was an interesting
                feature.</p>

          <h1 class="display-4">Problem Statement</h1>
          <hr class="my-4">
          <p>Summit Pet Rescue was designed to provide a platform for people to donate to the organization as well as
            for future pet owners to adopt rescued animals in areas local to Boulder. We have observed that our website
            isn't conveying information about the animals in a way that makes it easy for future owners to know what
            pets are currently available as well as the personalities and characteristics those pets might possess. We
            believe that making a website that has accurate, up to date and detailed information about the pets will
            lead to an increase in adoptions.
